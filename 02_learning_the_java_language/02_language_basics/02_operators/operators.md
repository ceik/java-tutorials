# Operators

## Unary Operators

`+`: Unary plus operator, indicates positive value
`-`: Unary minus operator, negates an expression
`++`: Increment operator, increments by 1
`--`: Decrement operator, decrements by 1
`!`: Logical complement operator, inverts value of a boolena

Increment and decrement operators can be applied pre- and postfix. The difference is that the prefix version evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version evaluates to the original value.

## Conditional Operators

`&&` and `||` are the conditional and and or operators in java. The second operand is evaluated only if needed.

`?:` is the ternary operator. It can be thought of as shorthand for if-then-else.

## Instancof

The `instanceof` operator compares an object to a specific type. This can be used to test whether an object is an instance of a class, an instance of a subclass, or an instance of a class that implements a particular interface. It is used like `x instanceof y`, whereas x is an object and y is a class, subclass, or interface.
